Pretend that the client who has contracted with you to write the LList software has looked over a prototype
 using your code and doing so has realized he made a mistake in explaining what he wanted with one of the routines ... 
so he changes the specs! He wishes to change how the test for equality works (I.e. ==): now two lists are considered 
equal if they contain the same number of items (nodes) AND all positionally corresponding nodes in the two lists contain
 the same value. Please change your code accordingly.





I have decided to make all of the iterator routines extra credit — they are not required for you to do.
 If you do them all correctly you can get +2 points extra credit. You must still let me know what you want me to
 test or not test in your comments at the beginning of your code.

Also - and this is very important - you must include stubs for ALL the routines in your code even if you do
not implement all of them. The attached program MUST compile and link with no syntax errors (warnings are OK).

Let me know if you have any questions.
